This kind of projects is still not very common in Egypt. In fact, people still like to
deal with traditional real estate agents and this is due to many reasons. For instance,
Egyptians are still not familiar with new technologies and the digital world in general.
However, we would like to replace this traditional way since finding a trustworthy
place to buy a house is still a difficult task for some. Therefore, this application will,
hopefully, facilitate this task of buying, or finding the appropriate house by providing
a platform that is available with all the necessary information that users might need,
as well as helping the user to find the best apartment according to their priorities. This
web application will save a lot of time and money for the users. In fact, it will be
available all the day. Therefore, this application is a tool that will allow, on one-hand
apartments owners to publish their properties: houses and advertise their possessions.
On the other hand, people will be able to view these goods and to choose the ones that
most suit their needs.


**Also using Analytical hierarchy process**
When, for a given problem, a decision-maker wishes to evaluate the performance of a
number of alternative solutions and multiple objectives are important, it may be
difficult to choose between alternatives. These alternatives can be evaluated in terms
of a number of decision criteria and sometimes an alternative is superior in terms of
one or some of the decision criteria, but inferior in terms of some other criteria. There
are several reasons for adopting the AHP method as a multi criteria decision making
tool. For instance, qualitative criteria, such as political or social factors, need to be
included in the decision-making process; a large quantity of criteria need to be
considered or, indeed, when dealing with future technologies, characteristics of these
technologies may not be well known
